## Background

At the time of writing I have been adding support for currently coop-only multiplayer to MegaZeux. 

In order for this to be possible, I need some way of sending inputs consistently across a network. Much like the multiplayer testing that's been done so far, I've settled on a non-networked, local variant for now.

## TODO

* [x] Revert a lot of the `update_event_status` -> `UPDATE_EVENT_STATUS_TICK` stuff and hook it into the event system in a much better way
* [ ] Allow stopping a demo by hitting, e.g., escape
* [x] File dialogue boxes
* [ ] "record demo" / "play demo" buttons
* [x] Actually use MZX's FS layer for writing a demo file
* [x] Loading and saving needs to work well
  * I tested this by accident. While a save does successfully restore, and while it's all theoretically doable as long as you never load a save made outside of the demo, when I tested it, the RNG seed desynced.
  * UPDATE: It's working now, but I do want this to be a limited filesystem sort of thing.
    * UPDATE 2: This wasn't fixed. It's fixed now. If you were to create a new save file during a demo which wasn't cleaned up before playing the demo, you'd get a desync.
    * Anyhow, file load / save is now replaced with a simple yes/no dialogue.
